# 👁️ Face Detection using OpenCV

This repository contains Python projects focused on **Face Detection** using **OpenCV**. The two main tasks involve detecting faces in **static images** and **real-time video** captured through a webcam.

---

## 📁 Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Face Detection in Image  
Detects faces in a static image using **Haar Cascade Classifier**.

**Features:**  
- Uses **OpenCV** for face detection  
- Processes an input image and draws rectangles around detected faces

---

### ✅ Task 2: Face Detection in Video  
Detects faces in real-time through a webcam video stream.

**Features:**  
- Uses **OpenCV** to access webcam feed  
- Continuously detects faces and draws bounding boxes around detected faces

---

## 🧠 Summary

These projects showcase practical applications of **Python** and **OpenCV** for **Computer Vision**:

- 🖼️ Image Processing & Face Detection  
- 🎥 Real-Time Video Analysis  
- 🤖 Object Detection using Haar Cascade Classifiers

---

## 📄 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

### Install OpenCV:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## 🚀 How to Run

### ▶️ Detect faces in an image:
```bash
python detect_face_image.py
```

Make sure to replace `test.jpg` with your image, and ensure `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` is in the same folder.

### 🎥 Detect faces in live video (webcam):
```bash
python detect_face_video.py
```

Press the `ESC` key to stop the video stream.

## 📷 Example Output

### Image Detection:
An example of how faces are detected in a static image with bounding boxes.

### Video Detection:
Real-time detection of faces from the webcam feed.
